I am a London based Graphic Designer. Mostly working across (but not limited to) the food, drink, hospitality and lifestyle sectors, with experience in graphic and editorial design for screen and print.

I have an inquisitive and considered approach to design. I enjoy collaborative work and project exploration through research, typographic experiments and illustration.
